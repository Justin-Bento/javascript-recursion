# Project: Recursion

After learning that recursion is the idea of a function calling itself, The Odin Project is having me write the fibonacci and Merge Sort algorithm to test my understanding. My goal is to give myself a week to fully grasp recursion and then implement the solution. This lesson is part of their JavaScript Course, under A Bit of Computer Science

## Fibonacci

The Fibonacci Sequence, is a numerical sequence where each number is the sum of the two numbers before it. Eg. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 are the first eight digits in the sequence.
